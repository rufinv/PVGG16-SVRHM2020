# PVGG16-SVRHM2020
Code and pretrained models for the paper: "Brain-inspired predictive coding dynamics improve the robustness of deep neural networks"


# Update
The paper, which was accepted for SVRHM2020, was subsequently changed and is now available at : https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.02749

The updated paper, which will be soon available in NeurIPS proceedings, introduces a package that can help anyone easily 'predify' their feedforward neural networks. The package, called Predify, is available at https://github.com/miladmozafari/predify. 

All the code for reproducing the results in the NeurIPS2021 version of the paper, along with the pretrained weights, is made available at : https://github.com/bhavinc/predify2021

The code for reproducing the results presented at SVRHM2020 should be a subset of the above repository.
